# Tic Tac Toe

## Introduction

This is a tic tac toe game against a single AI with (thought to be) perfect minimax implemented. 
Try playing against the AI and if you can win against them, please send us the feedback and email to [lvicotrico98@gmail.com](mailto:lvicotrico98@gmail.com).

Requires a python version 3.6.

To get started, first do:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

and then just run:

```bash
python3 main.py
# or
python main.py (if python is already by default using python3)
```

## Future Plan

- Add project to Docker (for convenience of installation)
